# Freeze Plugin

This is a [**Spigot**](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) Minecraft server plugin that allows you to freeze players in place. The plugin was originally made for [**Spigot**](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/), but it also works with [**CraftBukkit**](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit) and [**PaperMC**](https://papermc.io/) (**recommended**).

# How to use
Download the .jar file (link below) and run your Spigot, CraftBukkit or Paper server, and wait for it to generate **"plugins"** folder.

The plugin should notify the console that it has been enabled for the first time and you'll be good to go! If doesn't work go to section **Troubleshooting**

Settings:
- ```/freezeplugin settings gui {true, false or toggle}```

2.  ```/unfreeze``` - unfreezes specified player (if the gui option is enabled gui will be shown on your screen (doesn't work with console))
3.  ```/freezeplugin``` - you can see the plugin about, and you can change the settings by typing ```/freezeplugin settings``` (shows gui, for console shows list of settings)
