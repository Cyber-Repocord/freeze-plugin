# Freeze Plugin
 This is a [**Spigot**](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) Minecraft server plugin that allows you to freeze players in place. The plugin was originally made for [**Spigot**](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/), but it also works with [**CraftBukkit**](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit) and [**Paper**](https://papermc.io/) (**recommended**).

Download the .jar file (link below) and run your Spigot, CraftBukkit or Paper server, and wait for it to generate **plugins** folder.

2. ```/unfreeze``` - unfreezes specified player (if the gui option is enabled gui will be shown on your screen (doesn't work with console))
3. ```/freezeplugin``` - you can see the plugin about, and you can change the settings by typing ```/freezeplugin settings`` (shows gui, doesn't work with console)
